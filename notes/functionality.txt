1. While going through when something starts (executed/unit start, etc) we also need
to be able to keep track of when that same code exits/ends to be able to better display
the component execution pipeline
2. Figure out every example of components that we need to grab
3. Start to pull value of commands that are executed
4. Figure out data that is passed into anything that is called (this will make debugging
actual logs so much easier)
Example pull out the values from here that were passed into applyDiscount method:
[3]|01p4100000HR623|HelloWorld.applyDiscount(List<Book__c>)
